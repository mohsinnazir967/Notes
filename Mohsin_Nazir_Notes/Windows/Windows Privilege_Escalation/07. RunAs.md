# RunAs

Allows a user to run specific tools and programs with different permissions than the user's current logon provides.

**Runas** is a command-line tool that is built into Windows Vista. To use **runas** at the command line, open a command prompt, type **runas** with the appropriate parameters, and then press ENTER.

## RunAs Privilege Escalation via Stored Credentials

Finding stored credentials can be accomplished using one simple command:

```
cmdkey /list
```

Sure! Let's break down the command and what it does in simple terms:

### Command Breakdown

```
C:\Users\security>C:\Windows\System32\runas.exe /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c TYPE C:\Users\Adminstrator\Desktop/root.txt > C:\Users\Security/root.txt"
```

### What Each Part Does:

1. **`C:\Windows\System32\runas.exe`**:
    
    - This is the `runas` command, which allows you to run a program or command as another user.
2. **`/user:ACCESS\Administrator`**:
    
    - Specifies the user account to run the command as. In this case, it's the `Administrator` user on the `ACCESS` domain.
3. **`/savecred`**:
    
    - Saves the credentials for the specified user so you don't have to enter the password each time.
4. **`"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c`**:
    
    - Runs the specified command (`cmd.exe /c`) and then terminates. The `/c` switch tells `cmd.exe` to execute the command that follows and then exit.
5. **`TYPE C:\Users\Adminstrator\Desktop/root.txt`**:
    
    - Reads the contents of the `root.txt` file located on the Administrator's desktop.
6. **`> C:\Users\Security/root.txt`**:
    
    - Redirects the output (contents of `root.txt`) to a new file called `root.txt` in the `C:\Users\Security` directory.

### What Happens Overall:

- The command runs `cmd.exe` as the `Administrator` user.
- It reads the contents of the `root.txt` file from the Administrator's desktop.
- It then writes those contents to a new `root.txt` file in the `C:\Users\Security` directory.
