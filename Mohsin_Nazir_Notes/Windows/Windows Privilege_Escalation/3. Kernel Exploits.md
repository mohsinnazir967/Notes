Kernel exploits should be our last resource, since it might but the machine in an unstable state or create some other problem with the machine.

**Identify the hotfixes/patches**

```
systeminfo
```

```
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
```

**Python to Binary**

If we have an exploit written in python but we don't have python installed on the victim-machine we can always transform it into a binary with pyinstaller. Good trick to know.
