# Impersonation and Potato Attacks

## What are Tokens?

Temporary keys that allows to access a system/network without having to provide credentials each time you access a file. Think cookies for computer
### Two types:

**Delegate** - created for logging into a machine or using remote desktop.

**Impersonate** - "non-interactive" These are used for tasks that don't need you to be actively using the computer, such as attaching network drive or a domain log on script.

## Potato Attacks


1. **Trick the System**: The attacker tricks the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" account into authenticating via NTLM (a Windows authentication protocol) to an endpoint they control.
    
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: The attacker intercepts this authentication attempt and uses NTLM relay to impersonate a security token for the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" account. This involves specific Windows API calls.
    
3. **Use the Token**: The attacker uses the token they've obtained. This step requires the attacker's current account to have the privilege to impersonate security tokens, which is usually true for service accounts but not for regular user accounts.

- Binary available at : [foxglovesec/RottenPotato](https://github.com/foxglovesec/RottenPotato) and [breenmachine/RottenPotatoNG](https://github.com/breenmachine/RottenPotatoNG)

- Exploit using Metasploit with `incognito mode` loaded.

```
getuid
getprivs
use incognito
list\_tokens -u
cd c:\temp\
execute -Hc -f ./rot.exe
impersonate\_token "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
```
