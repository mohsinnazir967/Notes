### Vulnerability Details

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2019-1388
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Systems**: Windows
- **Exploit Type**: Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)
- **Root Cause**: Improper handling of expired or untrusted security certificates in Windows
- **Attack Vector**: Local

### Escalation Path

1. **Execution as a Low-Privilege User**
    
    - The attacker needs initial access to the system with limited user rights.
2. **Exploitation of the Vulnerability**
    
    - Windows incorrectly handles expired or untrusted digital certificates when displaying a warning dialog.
    - The prompt allows users to access the Internet through a web browser with administrative privileges.
3. **Spawning an Elevated Command Prompt**
    
    - The attacker can use the dialog to open Internet Explorer.
    - By interacting with the browser (e.g., opening a help page), they can access the file system and execute commands.
4. **Gaining System Privileges**
    
    - By launching a malicious payload or a new command prompt from the elevated browser session, the attacker can achieve **privilege escalation** to **Administrator/System** level.
