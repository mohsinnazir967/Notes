# Password & Port Forwarding

## Password

### In Files

Search for the password stored in the cleared text in files.

```
findstr /si password *.txt
findstr /si password *.xml
findstr /si password *.ini

#Find all those strings in config files.
dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*

# Find all passwords in all files.
findstr /spin "password" *.*
findstr /spin "password" *.*
```

## Port Forwarding

### Service only available from inside

*Sometimes there are services that are only accessible from inside the network.* 

For example a MySQL server might not be accessible from the outside, for security reasons. 

It is also common to have different administration applications that is only accessible from inside the network/machine. Like a printer interface, or something like that. 

These services might be more vulnerable since they are not meant to be seen from the outside.

```
netstat -ano
```
