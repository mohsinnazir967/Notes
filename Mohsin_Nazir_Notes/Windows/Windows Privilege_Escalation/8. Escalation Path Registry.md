## Autorun

AutoRuns refer to programs, scripts, or services that automatically execute when Windows starts or when a device (like a USB) is plugged in.

### Detection of Auto runs programs

1. **Run Autoruns**:
    
- Open **Command Prompt** and execute `Autoruns64.exe`.

```
	C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Autoruns\Autoruns64.exe
```
    
- Navigate to the **‘Logon’ tab** to check programs that auto-start at user login.

2. **Identify Vulnerable Entry**:
    
    - "My Program" is set to run automatically from:        
        makefile
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe`
        
3. **Check File Permissions**:
    
    - Use **AccessChk** to inspect permissions:
        
        arduino
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program"`
        
    - The output shows **"Everyone" has FILE_ALL_ACCESS**, meaning **any user (even non-admins) can modify** `program.exe`.
4. **Exploitation Possibility**:
    
    - Since `program.exe` runs at **logon**, an attacker can **replace it with a malicious file** (e.g., a reverse shell).
    - Upon restart/login, the system will execute the attacker’s payload, potentially leading to **privilege escalation**.
