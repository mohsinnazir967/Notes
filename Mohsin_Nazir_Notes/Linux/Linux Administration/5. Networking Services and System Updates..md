### Network Components

**IP**: The unique address assigned to each device on a network.

**Subnet Mask**: Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.

**Gateway**: The device that routes traffic from a local network to other networks.

**Static vs. DHCP**: Static IPs are manually set and fixed, while DHCP assigns IPs dynamically.

**Interface**: The network connection point of a device (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

**Interface MAC**: The unique hardware address of a network interface.

### Network Files and Commands


**Interface Detection**: Identifying network interfaces on a system.

**Assigning an IP address**: Setting an IP address for a network interface.

**Interface configuration files**: Files that store network interface settings.

- */etc/nsswitch.conf:* Configures name service switch functionality.

- */etc/hostname:* Stores the system's hostname.

- ~~*/etc/sysconfig/network:*~~ Contains network configuration settings.

	/etc/network ---> ==Debian==

## SCP - Secure Copy Protocol

The Secure Copy Protocol or ‚ÄúSCP‚Äù helps to transfer computer files securely
from a local to a remote host. It is somewhat similar to the File Transfer Protocol
‚ÄúFTP‚Äù, but it adds security and authentication.

Default SCP Port = 22 (same as SSH)

**Syntax**

```
scp <soource_path> <desination_user_name>@<destination_ip>:<Destionation_path>
```

```
sudo scp ./75+\ windows\ command\ üíª‚å®Ô∏è.pdf ruhab-qureshi@10.10.10.56:/home/ruhab-qureshi/Downloads
```

## rsync ‚Äì Remote Synchronization

rsync is a utility for efficiently *transferring* and *synchronizing* files within the same computer or to a remote computer by *comparing* the *modification times* and *sizes* of files.

Installation

```
sudo apt install rsync
```

syntax

```
rsync -options <sourcse> <destination>
```

- `-a` (*archive*): This option enables archive mode, which preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, and other attributes. It also recursively copies directories.
- `-z` (*compress*): This option compresses file data during the transfer, which can speed up the transfer process, especially over slower networks.
- `-v` (*verbose*): This option increases the verbosity of the output, providing more detailed information about the transfer process.
- `-h` (*human*-*readable*): This option makes the output more human-readable by displaying file sizes in a more understandable format (e.g., KB, MB).

**rsync on local machine**

*rsync a file on local machine*

make a directory on tmp

```
mkdir /tmp/local_backups
```

rsync the file

## Configure and Secure SSH

**Configure Idle Timeout Interval**

Avoid having an unattended SSH session, you can set an Idle timeout interval.

Edit your */etc/ssh/sshd_config file* and add the following line:

```
ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 0
```

Restart the service

``` 
systemctl restart sshd
```

**Disable root login**

Edit your */etc/ssh/sshd_config file* and add replace PermitRootLogin yes to no the following line:

```
PermitRootLogin no
```

Restart the service

``` 
systemctl restart sshd
```

**Disable Empty Passwords**

You need to prevent remote logins from accounts with empty passwords for added security.

Edit your /*etc/ssh/sshd_config* file and remove # from the following line

`PermitEmptyPasswords no`

Restart the service

``` 
systemctl restart sshd
```

**Limit Users SSH Access**

Limit your SSH logins to only anticancer users who needs remote access

Edit your /*etc/ssh/sshd_config* file and remove # from the following line

```
AllowUsers <username1> <username>
```

Restart the service

``` 
systemctl restart sshd
```

**Use a different port**

By default SSH port runs on 22. 

Edit your */etc/ssh/sshd_config* file and remove # from the following line and change the port number

`Port 22`

Restart the service

``` 
systemctl restart sshd
```

```
systemctl daemon-reload  
```
  
```
systemctl restart ssh.socket  
```

```
systemctl status ssh.socket
```
## Access Remote Server without Password (SSH-Keys)

Two reasons to access a remote machine

- Repetitive logins
- Automation through scripts

1. Generate the key

```
ssh-keygen
```

2. Copy the key to the server

```
ssh-copy-id mohsin@10.0.2.3
```

3. Login

```
ssh mohsin@10.0.2.3
```

## Cockpit

Cockpit is a server administration tool sponsored by Red Hat, focused on providing a modern-looking and user-friendly interface to manage and administer servers.

```
systemctl start cockpit
```

Use the IP of machine and port 9090 on the browser to access the web interface

```
https://10.10.2.15:9009
```

login to the web interface with username and password.

## Firewall

When data moves in and out of a server its packet information is tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed or not.

There are 2 tools to manage firewall in most of the Linux distributions

- *iptables*
- *firewalld ---> Default on Red-hat*
- *ufw ---> Default on Ubuntu*  
### Firewall (iptables ‚Äì tables, chains and targets)

Before working with iptables make sure firewalld or ufw is not running and disable it

To stop the service

```
systemctl stop firewalld or ufw
```

To prevent from starting at boot time

```
systemctl disable firewalld or ufw
```

To prevent it from running by other programs

```
systemctl mask firewalld or ufw
```

Installing iptables

```
sudo apt install iptables
```

```
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
```

```
sudo apt install netfilter-persistent
```

check the iptables rules

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìL
```

flush iptables.

```
iptables -F
```

*The packet filtering mechanism is organized into three different kinds of structures: tables, chains and targets.*

1. **tables** = table is something that allows you to process packets in specific ways. There are 4 different types of tables, *filter*, *mangle*, *nat* and *raw*.

2. **chains** = The chains are attached to tables, These chains allow you to inspect traffic at various points. There are 3 main chains used in iptables

	*INPUT* = incoming traffic
	*FORWARD* = going to a router, from one device to another
	*OUTPUT* = outgoing traffic

chains allow you to filter traffic by adding rules to them 
Rule = if traffic is coming from 192.168.1.35 then go to defined target

1. **targets** = target decides the fate of a packet, such as allowing or rejecting it. There are 3 different type of targets
	
	*ACCEPT* = connection accepted
	*REJECT* = Send reject response
	*DROP* = drop connection without sending any response

Structure of iptables 
![[Iptables_output.png]]

**iptables usage**

Drop all traffic coming from a specific IP (192.168.0.25)

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìA INPUT ‚Äìs 192.168.0.25 ‚Äìj DROP
```

Drop all traffic coming from a range of IPs (192.168.0.0)

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìA INPUT ‚Äìs 192.168.0.0/24 ‚Äìj DROP
```

List all rules in a table by line numbers

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìL --line-numbers
```

Delete a specific rule by line number

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìD INPUT 1
```

To flush the entire chain

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìF
```

To block a specific protocol with rejection (e.g. ICMP)

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j REJECT
```

To block a specific protocol without rejection (e.g. ICMP)

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
```

To block a specific port # (e.g. http port 80)

```
 sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
```

Block connection to a network interface

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i enps03 -s 192.168.0.25 -j DROP
```

Drop all traffic going to www.facebook.com

```
host -t a www.facebook.com
```

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìA OUTPUT ‚Äìd 31.13.71.36 ‚Äìj DROP
```

Block all outgoing traffic to a network range

```
sudo iptables ‚ÄìA OUTPUT ‚Äìd 31.13.71.0/24 ‚Äìj DROP
```

Block all incoming traffic except SSH

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

```
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```


After making all the changes save the iptables. Again make sure firewalld is not running

```
sudo ipatbles-save
```

*The file is save in /etc/iptables*

iptables saved file can also be restored

```
iptables-restore /LOCATION/FILENAME
```

### Firewall (firewalld)

Firewalld works the same way as iptables but of course it has it own commands

```
firewall-cmd
```

Firewalld also has the following:

- Table
- Chains
- Rules
- Targets

*You can run one or the other iptables or firewalld*

Make sure iptables is stopped, disabled and mask

```
sudo systemctl stop netfilter-persistent 
```

```
sudo systemctl stop netfilter-persistent 
```

```
sudo systemctl mask netfilter-persistent 
```

install the firewall package

```
sudo apt install firewalld
```

Start firewalld

```
systemctl start firewalld
```

```
systemctl enable firewalld
```


**Usage**

Check the rule of firewalld

```
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Get the listing of all services firewalld is aware of:

```
firewall-cmd --get-services
```

To make firewalld re-read the configuration added

```
firewall-cmd --reload
```

The firewalld has multiple zone, to get a list of all zones

```
firewall-cmd --get-zones
```

To get a list of active zones

```
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```


To get firewall rules for public zone

```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
```


**Add or Remove Services in firewalld**

All services are pre-defined by firewalld. What if you want to add a 3rd party service

```
/usr/lib/firewalld/services/allservices.xml
```

*Simply cp any .xml file and change the service and port number*
![[Firewalld_service_format.png]]

To add a service (http)

```
firewall-cmd --add-service=http
```

To remove a service

```
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http
```

To reload the firewalld configuration

```
firewall-cmd --reload
```

To add or remove a service permanently

```
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
```

```
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http --permanent
```

*To add a service that is not pre-defined 
by firewalld*

1. navigate to the directory

```
cd /usr/lib/firewalld/services/allservices.xml
```

2. Simply cp any .xml file sap.xml and change the service and port number (32)

```
cp mosh.xml sap.xml
```

3. Restart the service

```
systemctl restart firewalld
```

4. to verify new service

```
firewall-cmd --get-services
```

5. add the service

```
Firewall-cmd --add-service=sap
```

**To add and remove a port**

To add a port

```
firewall-cmd --add-port=1110/tcp
```

To remove a port

```
firewall-cmd --remove-port=1110/tcp
```

**Traffic Rules**

To reject incoming traffic from an IP address

```
firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address=‚Äú192.168.0.25" reject‚Äô
```

To block and unblock ICMP incoming traffic

```
firewall-cmd --add-icmp-block-inversion
```

```
firewall-cmd --remove-icmp-block-inversion
```

To block outgoing traffic to a specific website/IP address


```
host -t a www.facebook.com
```

```
firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 -d 31.13.71.36 -j DROP
```

```
firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" destination address="31.13.71.36" reject'
```
