# Disk Management and Run Levels

## System Run Levels

**System Run Levels**

System run levels are predefined states that a Unix-based operating system can be in, each with a specific set of services and processes running.

**Main Run level**

0 Shut down (or halt) the system
1 Single-user mode; usually aliased as s or S
6 Reboot the system

**Other Run levels**

2 Multi user mode without networking
3 Multi user mode with networking
5 Multi user mode with networking and GUI.

**Syntax**

```
init <run_level>
```

Shut down

```
init 0
```

Checking current run level

```
who -r
```

## Computer Storage

**Local Storage**

RAM, HDD, SSD, etc.

**DAS (Direct Attached Storage)**

CD/DVD, USB flash drive, external disk directly attached with USB or other cables.

**SAN (Storage Area Network)**

Storage attached through iSCSI or fiber cable

**NAS (Network Attached Storage)**

Storage attached over network (TCP/IP)
E.g. Samba, NFS etc.

## Disk Partition

Commands for disk partition

```
df -h
```

```
fdisk -l
```

**Adding another hard disk on Ubuntu VM**

Power off the VM add another hard disk and start the VM.

**Listing Disk**

Check the hard disk on our VM use the commands. notice that another `Disk /dev/sdb` is listed.

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

**Creating new partition on the disk**

```
sudo nfdisk /dev/sdb
```

the command will open the fdisk menu.

Use the menu command `n` to create the new partition and then `w` to write the partition.

now list the disk and notice the partition `/dev/sdb1` is present under `Disk /dev/sdb`

**Assign the file system type**

```
sudo apt install xfsprogs
```

```
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
```

**Mount the partition to a directory**

```
sudo mkdir /data
```

```
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /data
```

**Edit the `fstab` for automatic mount on reboot**

```
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

add this line in `fstab` ,save & quit.

```
/dev/sdb1	/data	 xfs	defaults	0	0
``` 

reboot the system and `/data` is mounted.

**Unmount**

```
sudo unmount /data
```

if want to mount again use this command.

```
mount a
```

## Logical Volume Management (LVM)

LVM allows disks to be combined together

## Add Disk and Create LVM Partition

### Add Hard disk

**Adding another hard disk on Ubuntu VM**

Power off the VM add another hard disk and start the VM.

**Listing Disk**

Check the hard disk on our VM use the commands. notice that another `Disk /dev/sdc` is listed.

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

### Create Partitions

**Creating new partition on the disk**

```
sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
```

the command will open the fdisk menu.

Use the menu command `n` to create the new partition. use `p` to confirm partition is created

Now, use `t` to change partition type and type `8e` to choose `LVM`.

Finally write the partition with `w`

now list the disk and notice the partition `/dev/sdc1` is present under `Disk /dev/sdc`

### Create Physical Volume

Install the `lvm2` package.

```
sudo apt install lvm2
```

**To create a physical volume type on partition use**

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1
```

Confirm with

```
sudo pvdisplay
```
### Create Volume Group

**To create a volume group use command.**

```
sudo vgcreate <group_name> <physical_volume>
```

```
sudo vgcreate ubuntu_vg /dev/sdc1
```

Confirm with

```
sudo vgdisplay
```

### Create Logical Volume

**Now to create a logical volume from logical group use** 

```
sudo lvcreate -n <logica_volume_name> --size 1G <logical_group_name>
```

```
sudo lvcreate -n ubuntu_lv --size 1G ubuntu_vg
```

Confirm with 

```
sudo lvdisplay
```

### Assign File System & Mount

**Assign file system**

```
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/<logical_group>/<logical_volume> 
```

```
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/ubuntu_vg/ubuntu_lv 
```

Create directory for mount logical volume 

```
sudo mkdir /ubuntu
```
  
**To mount logical volume**

```
sudo mount /dev/<logical_group>/<logical_volume> /<directory>
```

```
sudo mount /dev/ubuntu_vg/ubuntu_lv /ubuntu
```

Confirm with

```
df -h
```

## Add and Extend disk using LVM


### Add Hard disk

**Adding another hard disk on Ubuntu VM**

Power off the VM add another hard disk and start the VM.

**Listing Disk**

Check the hard disk on our VM use the commands. notice that another `Disk /dev/sdd` is listed.

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

### Create Partitions

**Creating new partition on the disk**

```
sudo fdisk /dev/sdd
```

the command will open the fdisk menu.

Use the menu command `n` to create the new partition. use `p` to confirm partition is created

Now, use `t` to change partition type and type `8e` to choose `LVM`.

Finally write the partition with `w`

now list the disk and notice the partition `/dev/sdd1` is present under `Disk /dev/sdd`

### Create Physical Volume

Install the `lvm2` package.

```
sudo apt install lvm2
```

**To create a physical volume type on partition use**

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdd1
```

Confirm with

```
sudo pvdisplay
```
