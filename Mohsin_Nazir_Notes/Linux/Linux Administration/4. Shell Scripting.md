## Introduction to Shell

**What is a Shell?**

*Interface between users and Kernel/OS*

CLI is a Shell
Windows GUI is a shell
Linux KDE GUI is a shell
Linux sh, bash etc. is a shell

*Find your Shell*

```
echo $0
```

*Available Shells*

```
cat /etc/shells
```

*Your Shell?*

```
/etc/passwd
```

## Types of Shell

- **Gnome**: A popular desktop environment for Linux, known for its simplicity and ease of use.

- **KDE**: Another desktop environment for Linux, offering a highly customizable and feature-rich experience.

- **sh**: The original Unix shell, also known as the Bourne shell, used for scripting and command execution.

- **bash**: The Bourne Again Shell, a widely used Unix shell that extends the capabilities of `sh`.

- **csh & tcsh**: The C shell and its enhanced version, tcsh, known for their C-like syntax and scripting capabilities


- **ksh**: The Korn shell, which combines features of `sh` and `csh`, offering powerful scripting and interactive use

## Shell Scripting

**What is a Shell Script?**

A shell script is an executable file containing multiple shell commands that are executed sequentially.

*The file can contain:*

• Shell (#!/bin/bash)
• Comments (# comments)
• Commands (echo, cp, grep etc.)
• Statements (if, while, for etc.)

Shell script should have executable permissions (e.g. -rw**x** r-**x** r-**x**)

Shell script has to be called from absolute path 

```
/home/userdir/script.bash
```

If called from current location then 

```
./script.bash
```

## Basic Script

1. Output to screen using “echo”

2. Creating tasks

• Telling your id, current location, your files/directories, system info
• Creating files or directories
• Output to a file “>”

3. Filters/Text processors through scripts (cut, awk, grep, sort, uniq, wc)

#### Practice : welcome_script

**Name**: `welcome_script`

**Description**:

- Welcomes the user with a custom message.
- Displays the current date and time.
- Shows the script's storage location.
- Lists all files in the directory.
- Provides disk usage information.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Creating 3 variabe to store the messgae and name and todays date

message="welcome to shell scpriting"

# Bacticks for commands substituion
name=`whoami`

# Preffered Method of command substitution $()
date=$(date)

# Using echo to out the custom msessage 
echo "$message $name"
echo
echo "Started your scripting on $date"
echo 

# usign echo and pwd to show the location scripts stored in
echo "you scripts will be stored in" 
pwd
echo

# listing all the scripts
echo "List of scripts"
ls -l
echo

# displaying the disk information
echo "Disk Information"
df -g
```


## Input & Output Scripts

**read**

Take the input from user and then use a variable to store the input store in a variable

```
read <variable_name>
```

*-p* ---> print message and take input

```
read -p "Message" <varaible_name>
```

**echo**

Output or print on the screen.

#### Practice : Addition Script

Take 2 number as an input from user, perform calculation and print the result

```
#!/bin/bash

# Script for addition

echo "Additon Calculator"
echo

# Getting input from user
read -p "Write the first number: " num1
echo 
read -p "Write the second number: " num2
echo

# Calculation
# Arithimatic Operation (( .... )) 

result=$((num1+num2))

# Output
echo "Sum of $num1 and $num2 = $result"
```


## If-then scripts

**Syntax**

if [condition] ; then 
	*do this*
else
	*do this*
fi
#### Practice : filecheck script

*Create a Shell Script to Check File Existence and Permissions*

```
#!/bin/bash

# Reading the files

read -p "Enter the filename: " filename
echo

# Checking files exist or not
if [ -e "$filename" ] ; then
 echo "$filename exist"
 echo
 # Check file readable or not
 if [ -r "$filename" ] ; then
         echo "$filename is readable"
 else
         echo "$filename is not readable"
 fi

 # Check file writeable or not
 if [ -w "$filename" ] ; then
         echo "$filename is writeable"
 else
         echo "$filename is not writeable"
 fi

 # Check file executeable or not
 if [ -x "$filename" ] ; then
         echo "$filename is executebale"
 else
         echo "$filename is not executeble"
 fi


else
 echo "$filename does not exist"
fi
```


## For loops Scripts

*Keep running until specified number of variable.*

**e.g:** 

variable = 10 then run the script 10 times

variable = green, blue, red (then run the
script 3 times for each color)

iterate through the each variables.

**Syntax**

for i in variable/list/file/directory ; do
	body
done
#### Practice : Loop through a directory and rename files

```
#!/bin/bash

# Read the direcoty path
read -p " Enter the directory path: " dir_path
echo 

if [ -d "$dir_path" ] ; then

        #iterate thorugh the files in the directory to rename
        for file in "$dir_path"/* ; do

                # Get the current name of file
                # # basename strips the directory and give only filenames
                current_name=$(basename "$file")

                # Define the newname of the file
                new_name="$dir_path/practice_$current_name"

                # Rename the files      
                mv "$file" "$new_name"

                echo "Rename '$file' to '$new_name'"
                echo
        done

else
        echo " The direcroty '$dir_path' does not exist"

fi
```

## Do while script

The while statement continually executes a block of statements while a
particular condition is true or met

e.g: Run a script until 2 vpm

**Syntax**

while [condition] ; do
	body
done

#### Practice : loop ends on positive number

```
#!/bin/bash

# The script will run until a positive number entred
number=0

while [ "$number" -le 0 ] ; do

        read -p " Enter a postive number: " number
done

echo "You entered a positive number: $number"
```

## Case Statements Scripts

Option based / Menu based 

**Syntax**

case variable in

choice_a)
choice_b)
choice_c)

esac
#### Practice : date, hostname & pwd selection

```
#!/bin/bash

# Printing Options
echo "Enter d to print current date and time"
echo "Enter p to print current working direcotry"
echo "Enter h to print hostname"
echo

# Taking user input
read option

echo

# use case for options based slection
case $option in

        d)
                date
                ;; # Double semicolon for block end
        p)
                pwd
                ;;
        h)
                hostname
                ;;

esac
```

## Script to ping other hosts

**Host**

```
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter host IP address : " host

ping -c1 $host &> /dev/null

if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
        echo "$host is OK"

else
        echo "$host is Down"

fi
```

**For list of IP addresses**

```
#!/bin/bash

# IP addresses list 
host="/home/sulmanasif/LinuxPractice/ShellScripts/hosts_ip"

# for loop to iterate ip address

for ip in $( cat $host ) ; do

        ping -c1 $ip &> /dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
                echo "$ip is OK"
        else
                echo "$ip is Down"
        fi
done
```

## Alias

Aliases is a very popular command that is used to cut down on lengthy and
repetitive commands.

**Usage**

```
alias <name>"<command>"
```

```
alias ls="la -al"
```

now **ls** will produce the same output as **ls -al**

**More examples**

```
alias pl="pwd; ls"
```

```
alias tell="whoami; hostname;pwd"
```

```
alias dir="ls -l | grep ^d"
```

```
aliaa wpa="chmod a+w"
```

```
alias d="df -h | awk '{print \$6}' | cut -c1-4"
```

**Printing all alias**

```
alias
```

**Delete an alias**

```
unalias <alias_name>
```

```
unalias pl
```

## Creating User or Global Aliases


**User** = Applies only to a specific user profile

*User = /home/user/.bashrc*

Edit this file 

```
vim /home/sulmanasif/.bashrc
```

add alias and save

```
alias tell='whoami;hostname;pwd'
```

**Global** = Applies to everyone who has account on the system

*Global = /etc/bash.bashrc

```
sudo vim /etc/bash.bashrc
```

add alias and save

```
alias tell='whoami;hostname;pwd'
```

## History Command

History of all the commands stored in.

```
home/<user>/bash_history
```

```
home/haji/bash_history
```

**Usage**
print all the commands executed.

```
history
```

use of a previous command from history

```
!<command_number_from_history>
```

```
!1662
```
